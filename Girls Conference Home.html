<a href="http://vimeo.com/102180380">Girls Conference 2014 - Promo</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/b4sq">Beaverton Foursquare</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.

Last January our Youth Department put on a Winter Camp for 7th through 12th grade students. It seems like “things” tend to always flare up after camps, and though it may be tough, it’s obvious that God is the one stirring things up in an effort to draw people closer to him and bring healing.

During the last 2 years I have had countless meetings with girls, or parents of girls, who are struggling with things that go so much deeper than the surface the world is allowed to see.

After our Winter Camp, several encounters with students led to me meeting with some girls and their parents. I was saddened and frustrated by seeing these young girls fighting through so much. ALL of our girls are struggling whether they are involved in the church with families that have attended for years, or they’ve never even set foot on church property.

A couple of weeks after camp I was worshiping during our Jr High service and the Lord hit me with this idea—a girls conference.

This conference isn’t about what is on the surface. We want to create a space where girls can hear from God and go to a deeper place with him.

Through much prayer and time with the Lord, he has shown me that so many girls don’t have a clear picture of who they are, and they don’t understand the heart of the God who created them and is in love with them.

We are created with purpose, we are created in the image of God, we have been known since before we were born, we are not alone but we have our Father at our right hand, we are called to rise up out of complacency, we are loved, we are pursued, we are known by God, we are daughters of the King, when we understand all of this, our lives and hearts will undoubtedly change forever.

I invite you to experience this God and to encounter him in a massive way.

You are invited to Girls Conference.
